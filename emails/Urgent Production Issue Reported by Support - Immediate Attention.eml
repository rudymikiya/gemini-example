I hope you're doing well. I wanted to bring to your immediate attention 
a production issue that has been reported by Asher from our support 
team. The details are as follows:

  * *Issue Reported:* Users are unable to complete transactions due to a
    "Payment Gateway Timeout" error.
  * *Environment:* Production
  * *Date and Time of Occurrence:* August 22, 2024, 10:45 AM
  * *Impact:* Users are unable to complete purchases, leading to
    potential revenue loss.
  * *Steps to Reproduce:*
     1. User adds items to the cart.
     2. Proceeds to checkout.
     3. Payment fails with a timeout error on the gateway.

Asher has noted that this issue is affecting approximately 500 users and 
has a critical impact on our operations. The support team is currently 
handling customer queries related to this, but we need an urgent fix to 
prevent further disruption.

Please prioritize this and provide an update on the resolution as soon
